## Banking System

I developed a banking system where the server-side program manages customer records, handling operations like withdrawl, deposits, and balances inquiries through socket-based model. Clients interact with the server by sending transaction details with the server processing them using mutex locks to prevent race conditions. The program includes a clock for calculating transaction execution time. Built using C++ on Ubuntu
